# HTML Semantic Structure Project
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. 
The goal is to build a complete webpage **using only HTML**, with no CSS or styling. 
The main focus is to practice **clean HTML structure** and **semantic tags** to make the content accessible and well organized.
## Objectives
- Use semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- Build the structure based on a Figma design file
- Do not add any styling or CSS
- Use proper nesting and indentation
## Resources
- Figma page: [link to your Figma file]
- Fonts: [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Spin Cycle OT]
